                <p>After google searching my own name during my Interactive Design class last semester, I was completely disenchanted to scroll through the dozens of other “Olivia Tucker’s” that are located all over the world. I considered adopting Ruby as my first name, but it was a bit late for it to catch on. Knowing how many others were seemingly stealing my identity as “Olivia Tucker,” I knew it was time that my design persona took on a bold transformation. I am still in the midst of coming up with my personal brand, but for now my stage name is otherwise known as OT. Follow me on my journey to become the best Olivia Tucker that I can be. <br><br>

                I will graduate in May 2021 from James Madison University with a B.S. from the School of Media Arts & Design, concentrating in Interactive Design. I am also minoring in British Communications and Studio Art. My background in Art and Photography have inspired me to combine my design knowledge with my interests in digital media platforms and user experience. <br><br>

                I am hoping to cast my net wide with my broad skillset, seeking job opportunities that will allow me to grow creatively, professionally, and personally. <br><br>

                Last spring semester, I interned in London, UK for Catapult- the creative division of VCCP Media. This position as Creative Intern has shown me that I want to be hands-on throughout the process of content creation. Whether it is interactive design, coding, visual effects, marketing, editing, or videography, I am eager to learn and passionate about all aspects of digital media.<br><br>
